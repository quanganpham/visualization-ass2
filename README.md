# Data Analysis and Visualization Project: Australian Open Champions

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a dataset of Australian Open champions to extract insights about nationalities, gender, and trends over time. The analysis will also focus on top-performing players who have won five or more times. The findings will be presented using a variety of visualization techniques to facilitate understanding and decision-making.
